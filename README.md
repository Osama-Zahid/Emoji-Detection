# Emoji and MNIST Classification
This project involves the classification of emoji images and MNIST digits using three different algorithms: KNN, Single Layer NN, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. This is written in Python and utilizes the scikit-learn library.

# Description
The project is designed to classify emojis and MNIST images based on their pixel values. The project is divided into two parts:

- Emoji classification: The project uses a dataset of hand-drawn emojis to train and test the algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify each emoji into one of several categories.

- MNIST classification: The project uses the MNIST dataset of digits to train and test the algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify each digit into its corresponding numerical value.
